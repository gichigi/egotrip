## Examples of Bad Copy (Avoid These)

### **Overly Anthropomorphic Language**
- ❌ "where the weather understands your standards" - Weather doesn't "understand" anything; this is awkward and nonsensical
- ❌ "destinations that appreciate your sophistication" - Places don't have feelings or appreciation
- ❌ "cities that respect your time" - Anthropomorphizing inanimate objects sounds forced

### **Overly Complex Metaphors**
- ❌ "weather that speaks your language" - Too abstract and unclear
- ❌ "destinations that whisper luxury" - Overly poetic and pretentious
- ❌ "cities that dance to your rhythm" - Cliché and doesn't add value

### **Redundant Sophistication**
- ❌ "exclusively curated for the exclusively discerning" - Redundant and wordy
- ❌ "sophisticatedly sophisticated selections" - Awkward repetition
- ❌ "premium premium experiences" - Unnecessary emphasis

### **Illogical Statements**
- ❌ "weather is non-negotiable" - You can't negotiate with weather; this makes no logical sense
- ❌ "weather that meets your standards" - Weather doesn't "meet" standards; it simply exists
- ❌ "atmospheric conditions that understand your needs" - Weather doesn't have understanding or needs

**Why these are bad:** They sound forced, don't add clarity, and make the copy feel artificial rather than naturally sophisticated. Illogical statements break the sophisticated tone by being nonsensical.

## Brand Voice Examples

## Implementation Notes

- **Elipses are powerful** - use "..." sparingly for maximum impact and implied understanding
- **Never be apologetic** - we're confident in our exclusivity
- **Assume sophistication** - never explain what a "flight time" or "sunshine hours" means
- **Create insider feeling** - make users feel like they're part of an exclusive club
- **Maintain peer relationship** - we're both sophisticated, not us serving them

This voice creates a brand that makes users feel like they're part of an exclusive club of sophisticated travelers, while the travel agent acts as their equally snobbish but devoted advisor who knows exactly where the sophisticated traveler belongs.
