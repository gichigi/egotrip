# EgoTrip Brand Voice Guide

## Brand Personality

**EgoTrip** is a tongue-in-cheek travel app for "high-performing individuals" who want to work remotely in sunny destinations while maintaining plausible deniability. The brand voice is sophisticated, self-aware, and playfully pretentious.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. **Sophisticated Self-Awareness**
- We acknowledge the absurdity of "strategic thinking" on beaches
- We're in on the joke but deliver it with elegance
- We speak to founders, executives, and high-performers who take themselves seriously (but not too seriously)

### 2. **Playful Pretentiousness**
- Use elevated language that sounds important but is clearly ironic
- Examples: "Strategic Sunlight Allocation," "Plausible Deniability," "Founder-Worthy Accommodations"

### 3. **Wink-and-Nod Humor**
- Subtle references to startup culture and founder stereotypes
- Examples: "burn rate," "Series A," "VC partner," "deep work"
- We know our audience is smart enough to get the joke

## Tone Guidelines

### **Primary Tone: Confident & Ironic**
- "Visionaries need their vitamin D"
- "Your thoughts deserve better weather"
- "Where 'out of office' meets 'out of excuses'"

### **Secondary Tone: Helpful but Sly**
- We provide real value while maintaining the playful facade
- "We understand that genius requires optimal lighting"
- "For maintaining the illusion of productivity from any beach"

### **Tertiary Tone: Exclusively Elite**
- "For the discerning founder who values both vitamin D and plausible deniability"
- "Properties vetted for both Instagram potential and the availability of standing desks"

## Consistency Rules

2. **Keep the humor subtle** - The joke should be clear but not obvious

4. **Stay in character** - Every piece of copy should feel like it's written by someone who takes themselves very seriously (but not too seriously)
5. **Balance utility with entertainment** - The app should work well while being entertaining

## Voice Testing Questions

Before publishing any content, ask:
- Does this sound like something a pretentious founder would say?
- Is the humor sophisticated enough for our audience?
- Would this make someone smile while still being useful?
- Does it maintain the brand's self-aware tone?
- Is it too obvious or too subtle?
